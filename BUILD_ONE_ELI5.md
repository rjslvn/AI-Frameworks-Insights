1. **Hyperparameters**:
   - Imagine you're baking cookies. First, you decide how many cookies you want to bake, how big they should be, and what ingredients you'll need. This is like setting up your 'rules' for baking.

2. **Transformers**:
   - Now, you have your flour, sugar, and chocolate chips, but they are all mixed up. You need to sort them out so that you can use them to make cookies. This is like the transformers sorting out different kinds of information (like words and pictures) so the computer can understand them.

3. **Fusion Mechanisms**:
   - Next, you mix all your sorted ingredients in a big bowl. This is like combining the different kinds of information so that they can work together to help the computer learn.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Now, you follow a recipe to bake your cookies. This is like giving the computer a special set of instructions (a model) to learn from the mixed information.

5. **Custom Loss Function (optional)**:
   - Suppose while baking, some cookies get burnt, and you want to count how many got burnt to tell your mom. This is like telling the computer how to check for mistakes while it's learning.

6. **Training, Evaluation, and Utilities (optional)**:
   - Finally, you bake the cookies, taste them to see if they are good, and maybe use some tools like a cookie cutter. This is like letting the computer practice, check how well it's doing, and use special tools to help it learn better.
