# Early Fusion for Action Recognition and Avoiding Recency Errors

Applying early fusion techniques can be beneficial in a multimodal setting like RGB-D for action recognition. The fusion can help the model integrate the complementary information from both modalities (color and depth), providing a more comprehensive understanding of actions in a given scene. Here's how you can specifically adapt early fusion to identify actions and mitigate recency errors.

## Steps for Implementing Early Fusion in Action Recognition

### 1. Preprocessing 

- **RGB**: Process the RGB frames as you normally would in a standard action recognition pipeline.
- **Depth**: Choose one of the depth representations (Raw Depth, HHA, or Surface Normal).
  
### 2. Data Alignment

- Ensure that each RGB frame is temporally aligned with its corresponding depth frame.

### 3. Early Fusion 

#### Using Joint-Embedder

- **Stack RGB and Depth**: Combine the RGB and Depth data channel-wise.
- **Embedding**: Use a single patch-embedding layer for the channel-stacked data.
  
### 4. Time Series Handling

- Aggregate a sequence of these fused embeddings to form a time-series representation of the action. This could be a simple sequence or more sophisticated temporal features.

### 5. Model Architecture

- Pass this time-series data through a series of Transformer blocks or RNN layers to capture the temporal dynamics.

### 6. Classification

- Use a classification head to identify the action from the final hidden state.

## Strategies for Avoiding Recency Errors

Recency errors occur when a model gives undue weight to recent observations at the expense of older but potentially more informative data. Here are some strategies to tackle this:

### 1. Temporal Attention Mechanisms
Implement attention mechanisms that weigh the importance of each time step, rather than just focusing on the most recent observations.

### 2. Sequence Shuffling
Randomize the order of your training sequences to ensure that the model does not learn a bias toward recent frames.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Use engineered features that capture long-term dependencies in the data, such as rolling averages or accumulative action scores.

### 4. Historical Context
Include explicit historical context features in your model to prevent the model from ignoring older but informative frames.
